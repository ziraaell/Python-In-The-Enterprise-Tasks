## Banking Simulator

This project simulates a basic banking system, enabling the creation of banks, management of client accounts, and execution of financial transactions. The goal is to model a functional and extensible banking structure while maintaining clean and readable code.

#### Task Desciption

The program implements a banking system that allows for creating new banks, managing client information, and performing various financial operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

- Each client account stores basic information, such as name, account number, and balance.
- Clients can perform the following operations:
    - Deposit money into their account.
    - Withdraw money from their account.
    - Transfer money between accounts (within the same or across different banks).
